## Description

Challenge #2- Building a digital portfolio! 

## Introduction 

In this challenge we were required to create our own code to build a digital portfolio. There were many challenges and also many victories. I loved getting to be creative and putting some of the knowledge i've gained to the test!

## Challenges

Creating my own code was very eye-openiong and challenging. It was fun being able to get in the groove of organizing it in a way that others could read it easily. 

I began by creating media queries to set up the mobile version of my digital profile:

I laid out the page using example pictures to see how they would appear in the large container:

## VIctories

Adding style to my profile was awesome! It was exciting to add some flair!

I also wanted to play with JavaScript a little and added button at the bottom at the page that changed the theme when they are clicked!
